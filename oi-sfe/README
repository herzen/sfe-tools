The files in this directory were used to produce the initial OpenIndiana
IPS repository which contained packages built from specs at the Spec
Files Extra repository.  The file packages.xml was read by a patched
pkgbuild to assign modern hierarchical names to SFE packages.  The
directory xslt contains scripts to make the information in that xml
file more readable.
