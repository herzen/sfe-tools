sfe-tools contains patches to pkgbuild and scripts which may be useful to Spec
Files Extra contributors, as well as anyone who wants to build packages for
Solaris using pkgbuild, a build tool derived from rpmbuild.  Spec Files Extra
(SFE) is a collection of spec files that define packages which complement the
official packages shipped by the Solaris 11 and OpenIndiana distributions.

So far, the only objects of interest contained in sfe-tools are a patch to
pkgbuild to make it set the facet action attribute for developer and
documentation files, and Perl scripts generating a report of how Solaris 11 and
OpenIndiana differ in their renaming of old OpenSolaris packages.

The URL of SFE is http://pkgbuild.sourceforge.net/spec-files-extra/.
