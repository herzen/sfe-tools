sfe-tools contains patches to pkgbuild and scripts which may be useful to Spec
Files Extra contributors.  Spec Files Extra (SFE) is a collection of rpmbuild-
like spec files that define packages which complement the official packages
shipped by the Solaris 11 and OpenIndiana distributions.

So far, the only objects of interested contained in sfe-tools is a patch to
pkgbuild (the modified rpmbuild used to build Solaris IPS packages) to make it
set the facet tag for developer and documentation packages, and Perl scripts
which generate a report of how Solaris 11 and OpenIndiana differ in their
renaming of old OpenSolaris packages.

The URL of SFE is http://pkgbuild.sourceforge.net/spec-files-extra/ .
