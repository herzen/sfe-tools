* Scripts
  - get-pn-symbols.pl :: Get list of all package name macros referred to by
       BuildRequires in all SFE specs, removing the leading "pnm_buildrequires_"
       from the symbols.
  - wrap-pkg-names.pl :: make list of package name macros suitable for use by
       print-pnm-values.pl.
  - print-pnm-values.pl :: Prints a list of the values that the arguments given
       to BuildRequires in spec files evaluates to (calls internal code in
       spectool.pl).
  - print-csv-mapping.pl :: Read files, each containing package names for a
       given distribution, and merge the same line from each file into one file
       with comma-separated columns.
  - create-yaml-file.pl :: Create yaml file used by pkgbuild from a csv file
       containing mappings from package name macros to actual packages
       specific to a given distribution.
  - mod-pnms-in-specs.pl :: Modify specs to use the package name map facility.
* Procedure
  1. Run get-pn-symbols to get a file containing a list of all package name
     macros currently used by SFE.
  2. Create a file suitable for use by print-pnm-values.pl from the file
     produced by the previous step, by running wrap-pkg-names.pl.
  3. On each distribution, run print-pnm-values.pl on the file produced by the
     previous step. 
  4. Run print-csv-mapping.pl on the results.
  5. Run create-yaml-file.pl and place the result in include/ in the specs
     directory.
  6. Run mod-pnms-in-specs.pl on the specs.
  7. Use the pkgbuild modified to use the new package name mapping yaml file.
