What's new in 1.6.0:

    for details.  The most important changes:
    - support for hard links (%hard modifier in %files)
    - support for source download mirror sites
  - (CBEautoconf) autoconf update to 2.61
  - (CBEautomake) automake 1.10 included (as well as 1.9.6)

What's new in 1.5.1:

  - cbe-install: SUNWvolu dependency deleted as it has been replaced by
    HAL.
  - (CBEsvn): disable parallel build

What's new in 1.5:

  - cbe-install: binary distributions of the JDS CBE are now available;
    fix the script so that it doesn't ask again whether you want to uninstall
    existing packages if you choose to always skip them.

  - (SFpkgbuild) pkgbuild updated to 1.1.1.  For the long list of changes
    see http://pkgbuild.sf.net/

    What you absolutely need to know:

    - pkgtool won't let you build as root anymore; use have to use an
      account with the Software Installation profile

    - each user has their own build directory structure, the default
      is $HOME/packages, redefine it by adding

	%_topdir /path/to/my/topdir

      to $HOME/.pkgbuildmacros.  The cbe-install script will do this
      for the user who installs the CBE.

    - pkgbuild's default buildroot is also per-user:

	/var/tmp/pkgbuild-$USER/

      this is where $RPM_BUILD_ROOT (per-package proto area) is set up

  - changed the default install location to /opt/jdsbld

  - update required compiler version to latest Sun Studio 11

  - update file attributes (root:other -> root:bin/root:sys) 

  - (CBEant) update to 1.6.5; now a required part of the JDS CBE

  - (CBEbison) update to 2.3

    README file in this directory

What's new in 1.4:

  - (SFpkgbuild) pkgbuild updated to 1.0.1.

  - (CBEautomake) include /usr/share/aclocal in the default aclocal search
    path

  - cbe-install: make it more user friendly for people installing the
    Solaris pkgs from CDs; add Sun Studio 11 to supported compiler versions

  - (CBEenv)
    - include a script called "ld-wrapper" which calls ld(1) with the -z
      ignore -Bdirect -z combreloc options.
    - env.sh and env.csh now set LD to ld-wrapper
    - env.sh and env.csh no longer unset DBUS_*
    - if JDS_CBE_ENV_QUIET is set to 1, env.sh and env.csh work silently
      (useful if you want to put them into .bashrc, like I do ;)

  - (CBEcvs) include %_datadir (share/cvs/contrib)

  - (CBEdiff) add gendiff: a handy little script for generating patches
    from changed sources.  Taken from rpm 3.0.6.
